        <h4>Places to play Poker</h4>
        <p class="normalText">In the United States, your best, and safest, bet to find a game of poker is to visit your local casino.
          However, in some states, casinos are not legal. In this case, you can typically find local home games with a simple google search.
          Keep in mind, that these games are not regulated and could potentially be dangerous.</p>
        <p class="normalText">Online poker is also an option if you live in the states, however, online poker is also not regulated
          by the government and inherits the same risks as home games found across the nation.</p>
